   <p>A health maintenance organization (HMO) is a type of health insurance plan that provides health care to its members through networks of doctors and hospitals. 
     HMOs are popular alternatives to traditional health care plans because they usually cost less.
      HMOs contract with doctors, hospitals, and clinics to provide health care within specific geographic areas. 
      These service areas may include all or part of a particular county. To be a member of an HMO, you must live or work in its service area
